#  Keychain and GnuPG >= 2.1

A while ago, I started using [keychain](http://www.funtoo.org/Keychain)
to manage my ssh and gpg agents. I did this with the following in my
`.bashrc`

    # Start ssh-agent
    eval $(keychain --quiet --eval id_rsa)

Recently, [arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) updated gpg to version
2.1.1 which, [as per the
announcement](https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html), no
longer requires the `GPG_AGENT_INFO` environment variable.

Unfortunately, tools like keychain donâ€™t know about that and still
expect it to be set, leading to some annoying breakage.

My fix is a quick and dirty one; I appended the following to `.bashrc`

    export GPG_AGENT_INFO=~/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent:$(pidof gpg-agent):1

:)

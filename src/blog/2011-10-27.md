#  Break In!

A while ago, I decided to learn how to use [the canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) and that for my
first project I was going to write a breakout clone. Pretty standard
fare for a first-time project :)

After writing some routines to draw blocks on the screen some weeks ago,
I finally got around to doing some real work on it this evening. Two or
three hours later, I'd ended up with a mostly working, radial version of
Breakout.

There are still some obvious bugs (the collision detection is a bit
shoddy) and it doesn't keep score or do anything special when you win
but it's reasonably fun and I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved in
just a couple of hours.

The code is released under the
`If-You-Steal-This-Without-Asking-Me-I'll-Bite-Your-Legs-Off` licence ;)

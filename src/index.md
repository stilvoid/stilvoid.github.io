## Professional

I work at AWS as a Manager leading a team of architects and software developers. My focus is on guiding technical direction, fostering innovation, and helping my team deliver impactful solutions for AWS customers.

With a strong technical foundation in cloud infrastructure and developer tooling, I combine hands-on expertise with leadership skills to drive team success. I'm particularly interested in creating environments where technical excellence and developer experience are paramount.

I try to keep my coding skills up to scratch by working on [games](games.md) and [CLI tools](tools.md) in my spare time. I'm the original creator of [Rain](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/rain), a deployment tool for AWS CloudFormation that is now officially maintained by the AWS CloudFormation team.

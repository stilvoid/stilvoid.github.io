# Steve Engledow

I work at AWS as a Manager leading a team of architects and software developers. My focus is on guiding technical direction, fostering innovation, and helping my team deliver impactful solutions for AWS customers.

With a strong technical foundation in cloud infrastructure and developer tooling, I combine hands-on expertise with leadership skills to drive team success. I'm particularly interested in creating environments where technical excellence and developer experience are paramount.

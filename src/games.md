# Games

I make low-effort games with [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and, sometimes, [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).

- [Lockdown](https://static.offend.me.uk/games/lockdown.html)

    Written for [Ludum Dare](https://ludumdare.com/) 50 in 2022.
    Survive the zombie invasion...

- [Muze](https://static.offend.me.uk/games/muze.html)

    My entry for [Black and White Jam](https://itch.io/jam/black-and-white-jam) in 2021.
    It's a simple maze game. Probably.

- [Santa's Skydive](https://static.offend.me.uk/games/santa-dive.html)

    My present to someone in a [Secret Santa Jam](https://itch.io/jam/secret-santa).

    Santa's sleigh has tipped over and dropped all the presents.
    Clearly, the only option is for Santa to skydive and gather them all back up.

- [Taaanks](https://static.offend.me.uk/games/taaanks.html)

    Heavily inspired by [Scorched Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Tanks).
    This is my entry for [LD](https://ludumdare.com/) 48.

- [Volver](https://static.offend.me.uk/games/volver.html)

    Spin the things to match the thing-holders.

- [Logoids](https://github.com/stilvoid/logoids)

    An [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) clone where you provide the Asteroid images.

- [Falsoyd](https://github.com/stilvoid/falsoyd)

    A terrible game I that wrote around 2000CE.
    <del>tbh I don't know if</del> it even compiles on modern systems!

# Command-line tools

I love the command-line. I grew up with computer that boots into a [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) prompt and learned how to write code when I was a kid. Although I use MacOS for the most part these days, I spent close to 25 years running Linux as my main OS which made me feel at home after my upbringing on the [Amstrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464) and [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500).

Some of these tools are more useful than others and some are definitely more actively developed than others.

## Actively maintained and useful

* [retro-sort](https://github.com/stilvoid/retro-sort)
    
    Sorts ROM collections into a folder structure suitable for use on retro hardware.

    `brew install stilvoid/tools/retro-sort`

- [git-get](https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get)

    A tool I still use every day.
    Replaces `git clone` but organises repositories by their origin under `~/code`.

    `brew install stilvoid/tools/git-get`

- [please](https://github.com/stilvoid/please)

    Please is a command line utility that makes it easy to integrate web APIs into your shell scripts.

    `brew install stilvoid/tools/please`

- [shue](https://github.com/stilvoid/shue)

    A command line tool for modifying and converting colour values for use with CSS etc.

    `brew install stilvoid/tools/shue`

- [PS1](https://github.com/stilvoid/ps1)

    My custom [bash prompt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bash/Prompt_customization)
    with some nice features. I've been using this daily ever since I wrote it.

## Less well maintained

- [Babel](https://github.com/stilvoid/babel)

    An easy-to-parse and easy-to-produce data exchange format
    for easing communication between processes
    written in different programming languages.
    There are definitely better choices for this now
    but I do have some ideas for a future iteration of this.

- [git-aux](https://github.com/stilvoid/git-aux)

    Allows you to use git to manage replicating your dotfiles
    between machines and that sort of thing.

- [git-cube](https://github.com/stilvoid/git-cube)

    Reminds you to commit before you exit a shell session.

- [maur](https://github.com/stilvoid/maur)

    A minimal tool for searching and installing packages from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

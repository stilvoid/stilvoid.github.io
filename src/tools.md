# Command-line tools

I love the command-line. I grew up with computer that boots into a [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) prompt and learned how to write code when I was a kid. Although I use MacOS for the most part these days, I spent close to 25 years running Linux as my main OS which made me feel at home after my upbringing on the [Amstrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464) and [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500).

# Command line tools

## Babel

<https://github.com/stilvoid/babel>

An easy-to-parse and easy-to-produce data exchange format
for easing communication between processes
written in different programming languages.
There are definitely better choices for this now
but I do have some ideas for a future iteration of this.

## git-aux

<https://github.com/stilvoid/git-aux>

Allows you to use git to manage replicating your dotfiles
between machines and that sort of thing.

## git-cube

<https://github.com/stilvoid/git-cube>

Reminds you to commit before you exit a shell session.

## git-get

<https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get>

A tool I still use every day.
Replaces `git clone` but organises repositories by their origin under `~/code`.

## maur

<https://github.com/stilvoid/maur>

A minimal tool for searching and installing packages from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

## please

<https://github.com/stilvoid/please>

Please is a command line utility that makes it easy to integrate web APIs into your shell scripts.

## PS1

<https://github.com/stilvoid/ps1>

My custom [bash prompt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bash/Prompt_customization)
with some nice features. I've been using this daily ever since I wrote it.

## shue

<https://github.com/stilvoid/shue>

A command line tool for modifying and converting colour values for use with CSS etc.

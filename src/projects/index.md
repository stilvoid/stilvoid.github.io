# Projects

I like to keep myself busy and sharp by making things.
Usually those things are [cli tools](/projects/tools.html), [music](/projects/music.html), or [games](/projects/games.html).

I haven't covered everything here but most of the rest of it is on [GitHub](https://github.com/stilvoid).

I like [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

#  btw

I discovered my new favourite fact about [my new favourite
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language)
recently. I suppose it should be obvious but I hadn't though about it in
explicitly these terms.

Given:

    char* myStringArray[] = {"Hello", "Goodbye", "Tomatoes"};
    int index = 2;

then the following will print `Tomatoes`:

    printf("%s\n", myStringArray[index]);

and so (this is the bit I hadn't fully realised) will this:

    printf("%s\n", index[myStringArray]);

Good times :)

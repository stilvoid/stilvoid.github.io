#  Why-fi?

I’m an [arch linux](http://archlinux.org) user and I love it; there’s no
other distro for me. The things that arch gets criticism for are the
exact same reasons I love it and they all more or less boil down to one
thing: arch does not hold your hand.

It’s been a while since an update in arch caused me any problems but it
did today.

[It seems there’s an
issue](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196584) with the
latest version of `wpa_supplicant` which renders it incompatible with
the way wifi is setup at boot time. The problem was caught and resolved
very quickly by package maintainers who simply rolled the
`wpa_supplicant` package back. However, I was unlucky enough to have
caught the intervening upgrade shortly before turning my laptop off. I
came home this evening to find I had no wifi!

This wasn't a huge challenge but I haven’t written a blog post for a
while and someone might find this useful:

If your wifi doesn't start at boot…

And you’re using [a laptop with no ethernet
port](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/xps-13-9333/spd/xps-13-9333)…

And you know an upgrade will solve your problem…

How do you get internet so you can upgrade?

Simples :)

==The steps==

First, find the name of your wireless interface:

    iw dev

Which will output something like:

    phy#0
        Interface wlp2s0
            ifindex 2
            wdev 0x1
            addr e8:b1:fc:6c:bf:b5
            type managed
            channel 11 (2462 MHz), width: 20 MHz, center1: 2462 MHz

Where `wlp2s0` is the bit we’re interested in.

Now bring the interface up:

    ip link set wlp2s0 up

Connect to the access point:

    iw dev wlp2s0 connect "AP name"

Create a temporary configuration file for `wpa_supplicant`:

    wpa_passphrase "AP name" "password" > /tmp/wpa.config

Run `wpa_supplicant` to authenticate with the access point:

    wpa_supplication -iwlp2s0 -c/tmp/wpa.config

In another terminal (or you could have backgrounded the above), run
`dhcpcd` to get an IP address from your router:

    dhcpcd wlp2s0

Update and reboot or whatever :)

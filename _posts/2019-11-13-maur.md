title: Maur - A minimal AUR helper
---

This post is about the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/). If you're not an [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) user, probably just move along ;)

There are [lots of AUR helpers](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=aur+helper) in existence already but, in the best traditions of open source, none of them work exactly how I want an AUR helper to work, so I [created a new one](https://xkcd.com/927/).

Here it is: <https://github.com/stilvoid/maur>

`maur` (pronounced like "more") is tiny. At the time of writing, it's 49 lines of bash. It also has very few features.

Here is the list of features:
* Help text when you type `maur --help` or `maur -h`
* A list of packages in the AUR when you type `maur` with no arguments
* Help you install a package when you type `maur <package name>`

The "help" when installing a package is this, and nothing more:
* Clone the package's AUR repository
* Open the `PKGBUILD` in your default editor
* Ask if you want to continue installing
* If you do, run `makepkg -si`

If you think `maur` needs more features, use a different AUR helper.

If you find bugs, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/stilvoid/maur/issues/new) or, even better, a [pull request](https://github.com/stilvoid/maur/compare).

## Example usage

### Searching the AUR

If you want to search for a package in the AUR, you can grep for it ;)

`maur | grep maur`

### Installing a package

If you want to install a package, for example [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay):

`maur yay`

### Upgrading a package

Upgrade a package is the same as installing one. This will upgrade `maur`:

`maur maur`

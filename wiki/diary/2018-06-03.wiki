%title Shue
:dev:tool:

I finally got around to releasing a tool I wrote a while back (git says I started it in November 2015).

It's called Shue and [[https://github.com/stilvoid/shue|you can find it on github]].

If you dig back in the [[https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/commits/master|commit history]], you'll see that Shue was originally intended as a tool for converting rgb colour values into their nearest equivalent [[http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html|bash colour codes]].

Shue doesn't do that now as I haven't really needed anything that does it since that one time :) I might bring back that functionality at some point but for now, here's what Shue *does* do:

* Converts colour representations between various rgb formats: 6-digit hex (e.g. `#ff9900`), 3-digit hex (e.g. `#f90`), and [[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp|CSS-style]] RGB values (e.g. `rgb(255, 153, 0)`.
* Perform a few basic operations on colours before converting to the various representations:
    * Invert
    * Darken
    * Lighten

I wrote this at the time because I was fiddling with a few websites and frequently needed the above functionality.

It's written in [[https://golang.org/|Go]] and there are binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the [[https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/releases|releases page]].

I discovered my new favourite fact about [my new favourite language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language) recently. I suppose it should be obvious but I hadn't though about it in explicitly these terms.

Given:

```c 
char* myStringArray[] = {"Hello", "Goodbye", "Tomatoes"};
int index = 2;
```

then the following will print `Tomatoes`:

```c 
printf("%s\n", myStringArray[index]);
```

and so (this is the bit I hadn't fully realised) will this:

```c 
printf("%s\n", index[myStringArray]);
```

Good times :)

%title Keychain and GnuPG >= 2.1
:shell:

A while ago, I started using [[http://www.funtoo.org/Keychain|keychain]] to manage my ssh and gpg agents. I did this with the following in my `.bashrc`

{{{
# Start ssh-agent
eval $(keychain --quiet --eval id_rsa)
}}}

Recently, [[https://www.archlinux.org/|arch]] updated gpg to version 2.1.1 which, [[https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html|as per the announcement]], no longer requires the `GPG_AGENT_INFO` environment variable.

Unfortunately, tools like keychain donâ€™t know about that and still expect it to be set, leading to some annoying breakage.

My fix is a quick and dirty one; I appended the following to `.bashrc`

{{{
export GPG_AGENT_INFO=~/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent:$(pidof gpg-agent):1
}}}

:)

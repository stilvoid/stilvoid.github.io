%title Maur - A minimal AUR helper

This post is about the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/|Arch User Repository]]. If you're not an [[https://www.archlinux.org/|Arch]] user, probably just move along ;)

There are [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=aur+helper|lots of AUR helpers]] in existence already but, in the best traditions of open source, none of them work exactly how I want an AUR helper to work, so I [[https://xkcd.com/927/|created a new one]].

Here it is: [[https://github.com/stilvoid/maur]]

`maur` (pronounced like "more") is tiny. At the time of writing, it's 49 lines of bash. It also has very few features.

Here is the list of features:

* Help text when you type `maur --help` or `maur -h`
* A list of packages in the AUR when you type `maur` with no arguments
* Help you install a package when you type `maur <package name>`

The "help" when installing a package is this, and nothing more:

* Clone the package's AUR repository
* Open the `PKGBUILD` in your default editor
* Ask if you want to continue installing
* If you do, run `makepkg -si`

If you think `maur` needs more features, use a different AUR helper.

If you find bugs, please [[https://github.com/stilvoid/maur/issues/new|submit an issue]] or, even better, a [[https://github.com/stilvoid/maur/compare|pull request]].

== Example usage ==

=== Searching the AUR ===

If you want to search for a package in the AUR, you can grep for it ;)

`maur | grep maur`

=== Installing a package ===

If you want to install a package, for example [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay|yay]]:

`maur yay`

=== Upgrading a package ===

Upgrade a package is the same as installing one. This will upgrade `maur`:

`maur maur`

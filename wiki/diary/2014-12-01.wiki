I had an idea a few days ago to create a Pebble watchface that works like an advent calendar; you get a new christmas-themed picture every day.

<del>[Here it is :)](https://apps.pebble.com/applications/547bad0ffb079735da00007c)</del>

The fun part however, was that I completely forgot about the idea until today. Family life and my weekly squash commitment meant that I didn't have a chance to start work on it until around 22:00 and I really wanted to get it into the Pebble store by midnight (in time for the 1st of December).

I submitted the first release at 23:55!

Enjoy :)

I'll put the source on GitHub soon. Before that, it's time for some sleep.

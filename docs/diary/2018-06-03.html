<p>
I finally got around to releasing a tool I wrote a while back (git says I started it in November 2015).
</p>

<p>
It's called Shue and <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue">you can find it on github</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you dig back in the <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/commits/master">commit history</a>, you'll see that Shue was originally intended as a tool for converting rgb colour values into their nearest equivalent <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html">bash colour codes</a>.
</p>

<p>
Shue doesn't do that now as I haven't really needed anything that does it since that one time :) I might bring back that functionality at some point but for now, here's what Shue <span id="Shue-does"></span><strong id="does">does</strong> do:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Converts colour representations between various rgb formats: 6-digit hex (e.g. <code style='background-color:#ff9900;color:black;'>#ff9900</code>), 3-digit hex (e.g. <code>#f90</code>), and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp">CSS-style</a> RGB values (e.g. <code>rgb(255, 153, 0)</code>.

<li>
Perform a few basic operations on colours before converting to the various representations:

<ul>
<li>
Invert

<li>
Darken

<li>
Lighten

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
I wrote this at the time because I was fiddling with a few websites and frequently needed the above functionality.
</p>

<p>
It's written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and there are binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/releases">releases page</a>.

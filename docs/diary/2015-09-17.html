            <h1>Twofer</h1>

            

<p>
After toying with the idea for some time, I decided I’d try setting up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">2FA</a> on my laptop. As usual, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">arch wiki</a> had a nicely written <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Google_Authenticator">article on setting up 2FA</a> with <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/tree/master/libpam">the PAM module</a> for <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator">Google Authenticator</a>.
</p>

<p>
I followed the instructions for setting up 2FA for ssh and that worked seamlessly so I decided I’d then go the whole hog and enable the module in <code>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</code> which would mean I’d need it any time I had to login at all.
</p>

<p>
Adding the line:
</p>

<pre>
auth  sufficient  pam_google_authenticator.so
</pre>

<p>
had the expected effect that I could login with just the verification code but that seems to defeat the point a little so I bit my lip and changed <code>sufficient</code> to <code>required</code> which would mean I’d need my password and the code on login.
</p>

<p>
I switched to another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_terminal">VT</a> and went for it. It worked!
</p>

<p>
So then I rebooted.
</p>

<p>
And I couldn’t log in.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of minutes to download an ISO to boot from using another machine, putting it on a USB stick, booting from it, and editing my <code>system-auth</code> file, I realised why:
</p>

<pre>
auth      required    pam_google_authenticator.so
auth      required    pam_unix.so     try_first_pass nullok
auth      required    pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap
</pre>

<p>
My home partition is encrypted and so the Google authenticator module obviously couldn’t load my secret file until I’d already logged in.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I tried moving the <code>pam_google_authenticator.so</code> line to the bottom of the <code>auth</code> group but that didn’t work either.
</p>

<div id="How could this possibly go wrong…"><h2 id="How could this possibly go wrong…" class="header"><a href="#How could this possibly go wrong…">How could this possibly go wrong…</a></h2></div>

<p>
So, the solution I came up with was to put the 2fa module into the session group. My understanding is that this will mean PAM will ask me to supply a verification code once per session which is fine by me; I don’t want to have to put a code in every time I <code>sudo</code> anyway.
</p>

<p>
My question is, will my minor abuse of PAM bite me in the arse at any point? It seems to do what I expected, even if I log in through GDM.
</p>

<p>
Here’s my current <code>system-auth</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
#%PAM-1.0

auth      required  pam_unix.so     try_first_pass nullok
auth      required  pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap
auth      optional  pam_permit.so
auth      required  pam_env.so

account   required  pam_unix.so
account   optional  pam_permit.so
account   required  pam_time.so

password  optional  pam_ecryptfs.so
password  required  pam_unix.so     try_first_pass nullok sha512 shadow
password  optional  pam_permit.so

session   required  pam_limits.so
session   required  pam_unix.so
session   optional  pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap
session   optional  pam_permit.so
session   required  pam_google_authenticator.so
</pre>

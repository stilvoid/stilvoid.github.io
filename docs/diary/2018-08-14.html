<hr />

<p>
The other day, something reminded me of a game I used to really enjoy playing back in my early days of getting to know Linux. That game was <a href="http://heroes.sourceforge.net">Heroes</a>. It's a clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre">Snake/Tron/Nibbles</a>) but with some fun additions, a nice graphical style, and some funky visual effects.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://static.offend.me.uk/media/images/2018-08-14-heroes-screenshot.png" alt="Heroes screenshot" />
</p>

<p>
So, of course, I immediately decided to install it.
</p>

<pre>
$ pacman -Ss heroes
</pre>

<p>
No results. Nothing in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository">AUR</a> either. There is only one other course of action: I'm going to create an AUR package for it!
</p>

<p>
It looks like the last change to the game was 16 years ago so it could be fun getting it to compile with a modern toolchain.
</p>

<div id="Getting Heroes to compile in 2018"><h2 id="Getting Heroes to compile in 2018" class="header"><a href="#Getting Heroes to compile in 2018">Getting Heroes to compile in 2018</a></h2></div>

<p>
I put together a basic <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD">PKGBUILD</a> that pulls down the source and data files from the Heroes sourceforge page and then runs:
</p>

<pre>
./configure
make
</pre>

<p>
Here's the first of what I'm sure are many failure messages:
</p>

<pre>
hedlite.c:48:20: error: static declaration of ‘tile_set_img’ follows non-static declaration 
 static a_pcx_image tile_set_img;
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from hedlite.c:44:
const.h:52:20: note: previous declaration of ‘tile_set_img’ was here                        
 extern a_pcx_image tile_set_img, font_deck_img;                                            
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
Some forewarning: it's been quite some time since I wrote anything serious in C and I was never an expert in it anyway. But I think I know enough to fix this and so just commented out the static declaration as, after poking around in the code a bit, it doesn't seem like it's necessary anyway.
</p>

<p>
Now the compilation succeeds but I get the following error during linking:
</p>

<pre>
/usr/bin/ld: camera.o: undefined reference to symbol 'sin@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
</pre>

<p>
Turns out that for some reason, the developers forgot to include the math&lt;small&gt;(s)&lt;/small&gt; library. I'm guessing that perhaps it used to be linked by default in a previous version of GCC.
</p>

<pre>
LDFLAGS=-lm ./configure
make
</pre>

<p>
Now it at least compiles correctly! Next up, compiling the data, music, and sound effects packages.
</p>

<p>
Amazingly, those all worked correctly and I was able to play the game!
</p>

<p>
However, this game was written a while ago and originally targeted MS-DOS so it has a window size of 320x200 which looks rather ridiculous on my 1920x1080 desktop ;)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://static.offend.me.uk/media/images/2018-08-14-heroes.png"><img src="https://static.offend.me.uk/media/images/2018-08-14-heroes-small.png" alt="Tiny Heroes window screenshot" /></a>
</p>

<p>
So I set about trying to set the default screen mode so that the game starts in full screen...
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, it looks like this is relatively easy. I just modified a few variables and changed a command line flag from <code>-F | --full-screen</code> to <code>-W | --windowed</code>.
</p>

<p>
Next up, rather than rely on <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>'s built-in scaling (it looks blurry and weird), I need to enable Heroes' quadruple flag <code>-4</code> by default. In fact, I removed all the scaling options and just left it to default to scaling 4-fold as that leaves the game with a resolution of 1280x800 which seems a reasonable default these days. I'm sure I'll receive bug reports if it's not ;)
</p>

<p>
The very last thing I've done is to enable the high quality mixer by default and remove the command line option from the game. CPU is a little more abundant now than it was in 2002 ;)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/heroes-0.21.patch?h=heroes">Here's my final patch file</a>.
</p>

<div id="Submitting the AUR package"><h2 id="Submitting the AUR package" class="header"><a href="#Submitting the AUR package">Submitting the AUR package</a></h2></div>

<p>
Things have changed since I last submitted a package to the AUR so here's a brief writeup - if only to remind myself in future ;)
</p>

<p>
First step was to update the SSH key in my AUR account as it contained a key from my old machine.
</p>

<p>
Next up, I added a remote to my repository:
</p>

<pre>
$ git remote add aur ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/heroes.git
$ git fetch aur  # This step causes AUR to create a record for the package
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to generate AUR's <code>.SRCINFO</code> file and rebase it into every commit (AUR requires this).
</p>

<pre>
$ git filter-branch --tree-filter "makepkg --printsrcinfo &gt; .SRCINFO"
</pre>

<p>
And then push it to the AUR repository:
</p>

<pre>
$ git push -u aur master
</pre>

<div id="Testing it out"><h2 id="Testing it out" class="header"><a href="#Testing it out">Testing it out</a></h2></div>

<p>
I use <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/packer/">packer</a> to make using AUR easier <a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/">I'm lazy</a>).
</p>

<pre>
$ packer -S heroes
</pre>

<p>
SUCCESS!
</p>

<p>
All in all, this wasn't anywhere near as painful as I'd expected. Time to play some Heroes :D
</p>

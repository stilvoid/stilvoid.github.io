<p>
I use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/">AWS CodeCommit</a> to host all of my private Git repositories. My repositories are split across several AWS accounts for different purposes: personal projects, internal projects at work, and customer projects.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up.html">CodeCommit documentation</a> shows you how to configure and clone a repository from one place, but in this blog post I want to share how I manage my Git configuration across multiple AWS accounts.
</p>

<div id="Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-Background"><h2 id="Background" class="header"><a href="#Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-Background">Background</a></h2></div>

<p>
First, I have <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html">profiles</a> configured for each of my AWS environments. I connect to some of them using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys">IAM user credentials</a> and others by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-a-single-iam-user-to-easily-access-all-your-accounts-by-using-the-aws-cli/">cross-account roles</a>.
</p>

<p>
I intentionally do not have any credentials associated with the default profile. That way I must always be sure I have selected a profile before I run any AWS CLI commands.
</p>

<p>
Here’s an anonymized copy of my <code>~/.aws/config</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
[profile personal]
region = eu-west-1
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

[profile work]
region = us-east-1
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

[profile customer]
region = eu-west-2
source_profile = work
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CrossAccountPowerUser
</pre>

<p>
If I am doing some work in one of those accounts, I run <code>export AWS_PROFILE=work</code> and use the AWS CLI as normal.
</p>

<div id="Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-The problem"><h2 id="The problem" class="header"><a href="#Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-The problem">The problem</a></h2></div>

<p>
I use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-https-unixes.html">Git credential helper</a> so that the Git client works seamlessly with CodeCommit. However, because I use different profiles for different repositories, my use case is a little more complex than the average.
</p>

<p>
In general, to use the credential helper, all you need to do is place the following options into your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file, like this:
</p>

<pre>
[credential]
    helper = !aws codecommit credential-helper $@
    UserHttpPath = true
</pre>

<p>
I could make this work across accounts by setting the appropriate value for <code>AWS_PROFILE</code> before I use Git in a repository, but there is a much neater way to deal with this situation using a feature released in <a href="https://blog.github.com/2017-05-10-git-2-13-has-been-released/">Git version 2.13</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_includes">conditional includes</a>.
</p>

<div id="Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-A solution"><h2 id="A solution" class="header"><a href="#Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-A solution">A solution</a></h2></div>

<p>
First, I separate my work into different folders. My <code>~/code/</code> directory looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
code
    personal
        repo1
        repo2
    work
        repo3
        repo4
    customer
        repo5
        repo6
</pre>

<p>
Using this layout, each folder that is directly underneath the code folder has different requirements in terms of configuration for use with CodeCommit.
</p>

<p>
Solving this has two parts; first, I create a <code>.gitconfig</code> file in each of the three folder locations. The <code>.gitconfig</code> files contain any customization (specifically, configuration for the credential helper) that I want in place while I work on projects in those folders.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<pre>
[user]
    # Use a custom email address
    email = sengledo@amazon.co.uk

[credential]
    # Note the use of the --profile switch
    helper = !aws --profile work codecommit credential-helper $@
    UseHttpPath = true
</pre>

<p>
I also make sure to specify the AWS CLI profile to use in the <code>.gitconfig</code> file which means that, when I am working in the folder, I don’t need to set <code>AWS_PROFILE</code> before I run <code>git push</code>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, to make use of these folder-level .gitconfig files, I need to reference them in my global Git configuration at <code>~/.gitconfig</code>
</p>

<p>
This is done through the <code>includeIf</code> section. For example:
</p>

<pre>
[includeIf "gitdir:~/code/personal/"]
    path = ~/code/personal/.gitconfig
</pre>

<p>
This example specifies that if I am working with a Git repository that is located anywhere under <code>~/code/personal/</code>, Git should load additional configuration from <code>~/code/personal/.gitconfig</code>. That additional file specifies the appropriate credential helper invocation with the corresponding AWS CLI profile selected as detailed earlier.
</p>

<p>
The contents of the new file are treated as if they are inserted into the main <code>.gitconfig</code> file at the location of the <code>includeIf</code> section.  This means that the included configuration will only override any configuration specified <span id="Using Git with AWS CodeCommit Across Multiple AWS Accounts-A solution-earlier"></span><strong id="earlier">earlier</strong> in the config.
</p>

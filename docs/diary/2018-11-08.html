<p>
Because I work on a lot of different projects spread across a lot of accounts at multiple git hosting providers, I try to keep my code folder in some semblance of order by having subfolders for things.
</p>

<p>
A while ago, I decided to make things even simpler by letting the git repos I was cloning dictate where they should live. I took inspiration from <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#ImportPaths">the way go expects you to organise your code</a>.
</p>

<p>
Today, I decided to apply <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">the three virtues</a> and wrote some code to handle this for me.
</p>

<div id="git-get-Introducing git-get"><h2 id="Introducing git-get" class="header"><a href="#git-get-Introducing git-get">Introducing git-get</a></h2></div>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get">git-get</a> is an opinionated git command that helps you keep your code folder in order.
</p>

<p>
You use git-get as a replacement for <code>git clone</code> and it will decide where your code should live :)
</p>

<pre>
git get https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get
Cloning into '/home/steve/code/github.com/stilvoid/git-get'...
</pre>

<p>
Laziness is the primary virtue.

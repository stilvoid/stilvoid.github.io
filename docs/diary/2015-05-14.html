<p>
Most of what’s here is hardly new ground but I felt it worth noting down the current strategy we’re using to develop and build what we’re working on at <a href="http://www.locationsciences.ai/">Proxama</a>.
</p>

<p>
Without going into any of the details, it’s a web application with a front end written using <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> and various services that it calls out to, written using whatever seems appropriate per service.
</p>

<p>
At the outset of the project, we decided we would bite the bullet and build for <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> from the outset. This meant we would get to avoid the usual dependency and developer environment setup nightmares.
</p>

<div id="The problem"><h2 id="The problem" class="header"><a href="#The problem">The problem</a></h2></div>

<p>
What we quickly realised as we started to put the bare bones of a few of the services in place, was that we had three seemingly conflicting goals for each component and for the application as a whole.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Build images that can be deployed in production.

<li>
Allow developers to run services locally.

<li>
Provide a means for running unit tests (both by developers and our CI server).

</ul>
<p>
So here’s what we've ended up with:
</p>

<div id="The solution"><h2 id="The solution" class="header"><a href="#The solution">The solution</a></h2></div>

<p>
_Or: <a href="http://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> to the rescue_
</p>

<div id="The solution-Folder structure"><h3 id="Folder structure" class="header"><a href="#The solution-Folder structure">Folder structure</a></h3></div>

<p>
Here’s what the project layout looks like:
</p>

<pre>
Project
|
+-docker-compose.yml
|
+-Service 1
| |
| +-Dockerfile
| |
| +-docker.compose.yml
| |
| +-&lt;other files&gt;
|
+-Service 2
  |
  |
  +-Dockerfile
  |
  +-docker.compose.yml
  |
  +-&lt;other files&gt;
</pre>

<div id="The solution-Building for production"><h3 id="Building for production" class="header"><a href="#The solution-Building for production">Building for production</a></h3></div>

<p>
This is the easy bit and is where we started first. The <code>Dockerfile</code> for each service was designed to run everything with the defaults. Usually, this is something simple like:
</p>

<pre>
FROM python:3-onbuild
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
</pre>

<p>
Our CI server can easily take these, produce images, and push them to the registry.
</p>

<div id="The solution-Allowing developers to run services locally"><h3 id="Allowing developers to run services locally" class="header"><a href="#The solution-Allowing developers to run services locally">Allowing developers to run services locally</a></h3></div>

<p>
This is slightly harder. In general, each service wants to do something slightly different when being run for development; e.g. automatically restarting when code changes. Additionally, we don’t want to have to rebuild an image every time we make a code change. This is where <code>docker-compose</code> comes in handy.
</p>

<p>
The <code>docker-compose.yml</code> at the root of the project folder looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
service1:
    build: Service 1
    environment:
        ENV: dev
    volumes:
        - Service 1:/usr/src/app
    links:
        - service2
        - db
    ports:
        - 8001:8000

service2:
    build: Service2
    environment:
        ENV: dev
    volumes:
        - Service 2:/usr/src/app
    links:
        - service1
        - db
    ports:
        - 8002:8000

db:
    image: mongo
</pre>

<p>
This gives us several features right away:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We can locally run all of the services together with <code>docker-compose up</code>

<li>
The <code>ENV</code> environment variable is set to <code>dev</code> in each service so that the service can configure itself when it starts to run things in "dev" mode where needed.

<li>
The source folder for each service is mounted inside the container. This means you don’t need to rebuild the image to try out new code.

<li>
Each service is bound to a different port so you can connect to each part directly where needed.

<li>
Each service defines links to the other services it needs.

</ul>
<div id="The solution-Running the tests"><h3 id="Running the tests" class="header"><a href="#The solution-Running the tests">Running the tests</a></h3></div>

<p>
This was the trickiest part to get right. Some services have dependencies on other things even just to get unit tests running. For example, <a href="http://python-eve.org/">Eve</a> is a huge pain to get running with a fake database so it’s much easier to just link it to a temporary "real" database.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, we didn't want to mess with the idea that the images should run production services by default but also didn’t want to require folks to need to churn out complicated <code>docker</code> invocations like <code>docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app --link db:db service1 python -m unittest</code> just to run the test suite after coding up some new features.
</p>

<p>
So, it was docker-compose to the rescue again :)
</p>

<p>
Each service has a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that looks something like:
</p>

<pre>
tests:
    build: .
    command: python -m unittest
    volumes:
        - .:/usr/src/app
    links:
        - db

db:
    image: mongo
</pre>

<p>
Which sets up any dependencies needed just for the tests, mounts the local source in the container, and runs the desired command for running the tests.
</p>

<p>
So, a developer (or the CI box) can run the unit tests with:
</p>

<pre>
docker-compose run tests
</pre>

<div id="Summary"><h2 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#Summary">Summary</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Each <code>Dockerfile</code> builds an image that can go straight into production without further configuration required.

<li>
Each image runs in "developer mode" if the <code>ENV</code> environment variable is set.

<li>
Running <code>docker-compose up</code> from the root of the project gets you a full stack running locally in developer mode.

<li>
Running <code>docker-compose run tests</code> in each service’s own folder will run the unit tests for that service - starting any dependencies as needed.

</ul>

For a while now, I’ve been wanting to keep various parts of my home directory in sync.
</p>

<p>
At first, I created a git repository for storing my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotfile#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments">dotfiles</a> but I found it a pain to keep the repository up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
Fairly recently, someone pointed out <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> to me. After a good read of the documentation, it sounded like it could be useful but probably more than I needed and perhaps not quite what I really wanted. Besides, I couldn’t get the bloody thing to install.
</p>

<p>
So I did what any geek would do, I wrote my own :D
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/git-aux">git-aux</a> (or <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-aux-git/">AUR</a> if you’re on <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>).
</p>

<p>
Basically, I wanted an easy to way to keep a git repository in sync with an directory external to it. With git aux installed, I get pretty much exactly what I wanted with a few simple commands.
</p>

<p>
After creating a new git repository, I do <code>git aux init ~/</code> to tell git-aux that I want it to sync this repo with my home directory.
</p>

<p>
I then do <code>git aux add ~/.vimrc ~/.ssh/config ~/.bashrc</code> and any other files I want from my home directory. This copies those files into the repository and I can then commit them in the usual way.
</p>

<p>
If I make changes in my home directory, I use <code>git aux sync</code> to update the copies in the repository.
</p>

<p>
If I’ve made changes on another machine and want to apply those changes from the repo to the home dir on this machine, I do <code>git aux apply</code>.
</p>

<p>
And that’s it :)
</p>

<p>
It’s unfinished and probably broken in places but mostly does what I was looking for.

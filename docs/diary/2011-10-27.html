A while ago, I decided to learn how to use [the canvas](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element)</a> and that for my first project I was going to write a breakout clone. Pretty standard fare for a first-time project :)
</p>

<p>
After writing some routines to draw blocks on the screen some weeks ago, I finally got around to doing some real work on it this evening. Two or three hours later, I'd ended up with a mostly working, radial version of Breakout.

There are still some obvious bugs (the collision detection is a bit shoddy) and it doesn't keep score or do anything special when you win but it's reasonably fun and I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved in just a couple of hours.

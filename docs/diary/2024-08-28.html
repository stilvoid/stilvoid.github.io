In tidying up my corner of the interwebs, I put together a list of <a href="../projects.html">projects</a> that I've worked on over the years. One of those is <a href="../projects.html#Games">Falsoyd</a>. I commented "I don't know if it even compiles on modern systems". Of course, that stuck in my head and inevitably I had to try...
</p>

<p>
Hoooo boy.
</p>

<p>
It has been a <em>long time</em> since I wrote anything in my <a href="2014-01-31.html">once-favourite language, C</a> (or C++). <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Astilvoid+AND+%28language%3AC+OR+language%3AC%2B%2B%29&amp;type=code">A GitHub search</a> suggests it's been around 10 years. Fortunately, I had no intentions of really fixing any coding problems - just getting Falsoyd to run by brute force :D
</p>

<div id="It starts"><h2 id="It starts" class="header"><a href="#It starts">It starts</a></h2></div>

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:stilvoid/falysoyd
cd falsoyd
make
...
sdl-config: command not found
fatal error: 'SDL_mixer.h' file not found
</pre>

<p>
Oh yeah, this was all SDL. Oh well, I'm sure that's still around!
</p>

<pre>
brew install sdl
Warning: Formula sdl was renamed to sdl12-compat.
</pre>

<p>
Ok well, it turns out SDL1.2 is looong deprecated but some kind person has written a compatibility library for SDL2 so that should all work quite nicely...
</p>

<pre>
make
fatal error: 'SDL_mixer.h' file not found
brew install sdl_mixer
Error: sdl_mixer has been disabled because it is deprecated upstream! It was disabled on 2024-02-07.
</pre>

<p>
If only I had tried this 6 months ago ;) After a quick look, SDL2_mixer seems to have the same API as in SDL1.2 so I'll nab the header file from there, include it in my CFLAGS, and link to SDL2_mixer in addition to the SDL1.2 (compat) library. What could possibly go wrong?!
</p>

<pre>
make
...
src/map.h:35:6: error: cast from pointer to smaller type 'int' loses information
        p.x=(int)x;
            ^~~~~~
src/map.h:36:6: error: cast from pointer to smaller type 'int' loses information
        p.y=(int)y;
</pre>

<p>
Ooh, an actual bug. Forgot to dereference some pointers. I wonder how that ever worked before. Well, it's an easy fix!
</p>

<pre>
make
...
g++  src/world.o src/audio.o src/score.o src/bonus.o src/shot.o src/sprite.o src/ship.o src/alien.o src/main.o -o src/falsoyd `sdl-config --libs` -lSDL2_mixer
</pre>

<p>
It compiled! That was unexpectedly easy. I was anticipating some nastiness with mixing SDL1.2 and SDL2_mixer.
</p>

<p>
(I glossed over <em>a lot</em> of compiler warnings in that "..." btw. Don't ignore your compiler warnings, folks!)
</p>

<p>
My fingers began to tremble (they didn't) as I nervously (I wasn't) typed <code>./src/falsoyd</code>...
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://static.offend.me.uk/media/images/2024-08-28-falsoyd.png" alt="A screenshot of Falsoyd" />
</p>

<p>
It runs! I played it for a little while. Remembered how terrible it was and committed <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/falsoyd/tree/2024">a branch</a> with my changes. That'll do for now. Itch scratched.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm clearly going to have to make Falsoyd 2 in Löve, Pico-8, or Picotron ;)

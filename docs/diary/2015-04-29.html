I’m an <a href="http://archlinux.org">arch linux</a> user and I love it; there’s no other distro for me. The things that arch gets criticism for are the exact same reasons I love it and they all more or less boil down to one thing: arch does not hold your hand.
</p>

<p>
It’s been a while since an update in arch caused me any problems but it did today.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196584">It seems there’s an issue</a> with the latest version of <code>wpa_supplicant</code> which renders it incompatible with the way wifi is setup at boot time. The problem was caught and resolved very quickly by package maintainers who simply rolled the <code>wpa_supplicant</code> package back. However, I was unlucky enough to have caught the intervening upgrade shortly before turning my laptop off. I came home this evening to find I had no wifi!
</p>

<p>
This wasn’t a huge challenge but I haven’t written a blog post for a while and someone might find this useful:

If your wifi doesn’t start at boot…
</p>

<p>
And you’re using <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/xps-13-9333/spd/xps-13-9333">a laptop with no ethernet port</a>…
</p>

<p>
And you know an upgrade will solve your problem…
</p>

<p>
How do you get internet so you can upgrade?
</p>

<p>
Simples :)

First, find the name of your wireless interface:
</p>

<pre>
iw dev
</pre>

<p>
Which will output something like:
</p>

<pre>
phy#0
    Interface wlp2s0
        ifindex 2
        wdev 0x1
        addr e8:b1:fc:6c:bf:b5
        type managed
        channel 11 (2462 MHz), width: 20 MHz, center1: 2462 MHz
</pre>

<p>
Where <code>wlp2s0</code> is the bit we’re interested in.
</p>

<p>
Now bring the interface up:
</p>

<pre>
ip link set wlp2s0 up
</pre>

<p>
Connect to the access point:
</p>

<pre>
iw dev wlp2s0 connect "AP name"
</pre>

<p>
Create a temporary configuration file for <code>wpa_supplicant</code>:
</p>

<pre>
wpa_passphrase "AP name" "password" &gt; /tmp/wpa.config
</pre>

<p>
Run <code>wpa_supplicant</code> to authenticate with the access point:
</p>

<pre>
wpa_supplication -iwlp2s0 -c/tmp/wpa.config
</pre>

<p>
In another terminal (or you could have backgrounded the above), run <code>dhcpcd</code> to get an IP address from your router:
</p>

<pre>
dhcpcd wlp2s0
</pre>

<p>
Update and reboot or whatever :)

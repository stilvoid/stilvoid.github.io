Maybe it’s just me, but I reckon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSLs</a> are the next (ok ok, they’ve been around for ages) big (ok, hipster) thing. I know I’m by no means the first to say so it’s just that I’m increasingly bemused at seeing things squeezed into data structures they’ve outgrown.
</p>

<p>
In general, as everyone’s finally warming to the idea that you can use code to describe not just your application but also how it’s deployed, we’re reaching a state where that code needs to be newbie-friendly - by which I mean that it ought to be easily understandable by humans. If it isn’t, it’s prone to mistakes.

A few months ago, I experimented with creating a DSL for writing web pages and I was fairly happy with <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/thiy">the result</a> (though there’s lots more work to be done). I’m thinking of applying the same ideas to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>.

<pre>
resources:
    db:
        type: rds
        engine: mysql
        size: c3.xlarge

    app:
        type: ec2
        ami: my-app-image
        size: t2.micro
        scale:
            min: 1
            max: 10
        expose: 80

security:
    db: app
    app: 0.0.0.0:80
</pre>

<p>
Obviously I’ve put little to no thought into the above but it shouldn’t be too hard to come up with something useful.
</p>

<p>
Maybe some day soon ;)

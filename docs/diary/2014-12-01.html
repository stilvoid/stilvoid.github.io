<p>
I had an idea a few days ago to create a Pebble watchface that works like an advent calendar; you get a new christmas-themed picture every day.
</p>

<p>
Here it <del>is :)</del> was: <a href="https://apps.pebble.com/applications/547bad0ffb079735da00007c">https://apps.pebble.com/applications/547bad0ffb079735da00007c</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Update 2024: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)">Pebble</a> is long gone and so is the site that hosted my watchfaces :(

</p></blockquote>
</pre></code>
<p>
The fun part however, was that I completely forgot about the idea until today. Family life and my weekly squash commitment meant that I didn’t have a chance to start work on it until around 22:00 and I really wanted to get it into the Pebble store by midnight (in time for the 1st of December).
</p>

<p>
I submitted the first release at 23:55!
</p>

<p>
Enjoy :)
</p>

<p>
I’ll put the source on GitHub soon. Before that, it’s time for some sleep.

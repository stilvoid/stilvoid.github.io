Today I become a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">add-on</a> developer!
</p>

<p>
Really, it was far too easy and a little disappointing that I needed to bother, as all I needed was a simple way to hide the browser chrome when I wanted a little more screen space for the content or I wanted a distraction-free environment for reading an article.
</p>

<p>
I wrote <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/focus-mode/">Focus Mode</a> for Firefox to do just that :)
</p>

<p>
Now, someone tell me why that’s not already a standard feature in Firefox. Or even better, tell me that it is and that I just failed to notice it. And while you’re at it, tell me why I couldn’t find an existing extension that does it!

            <article><p>For the end result of this post, see <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroes/">my AUR package of Heroes</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The other day, something reminded me of a game I used to really enjoy playing back in my early days of getting to know Linux. That game was <a href="http://heroes.sourceforge.net">Heroes</a>. It's a clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake/Tron/Nibbles</a> but with some fun additions, a nice graphical style, and some funky visual effects.</p>
<p><img alt="Heroes screenshot" src="http://heroes.sourceforge.net/img/snap5.png" /></p>
<p>So, of course, I immediately decided to install it.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>pacman<span class="w"> </span>-Ss<span class="w"> </span>heroes
</code></pre></div>

<p>No results. Nothing in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository">AUR</a> either. There is only one other course of action: I'm going to create an AUR package for it!</p>
<p>It looks like the last change to the game was 16 years ago so it could be fun getting it to compile with a modern toolchain.</p>
<h2>Getting Heroes to compile in 2018</h2>
<p>I put together a basic <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD">PKGBUILD</a> that pulls down the source and data files from the Heroes sourceforge page and then runs:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="go">./configure</span>
<span class="go">make</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here's the first of what I'm sure are many failure messages:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="go">hedlite.c:48:20: error: static declaration of ‘tile_set_img’ follows non-static declaration </span>
<span class="go"> static a_pcx_image tile_set_img;</span>
<span class="go">                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~</span>
<span class="go">In file included from hedlite.c:44:</span>
<span class="go">const.h:52:20: note: previous declaration of ‘tile_set_img’ was here                        </span>
<span class="go"> extern a_pcx_image tile_set_img, font_deck_img;                                            </span>
<span class="go">                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Some forewarning: it's been quite some time since I wrote anything serious in C and I was never an expert in it anyway. But I think I know enough to fix this and so just commented out the static declaration as, after poking around in the code a bit, it doesn't seem like it's necessary anyway.</p>
<p>Now the compilation succeeds but I get the following error during linking:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="go">/usr/bin/ld: camera.o: undefined reference to symbol &#39;sin@@GLIBC_2.2.5&#39;</span>
<span class="go">/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out that for some reason, the developers forgot to include the math<small>(s)</small> library. I'm guessing that perhaps it used to be linked by default in a previous version of GCC.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="go">LDFLAGS=-lm ./configure</span>
<span class="go">make</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now it at least compiles correctly! Next up, compiling the data, music, and sound effects packages.</p>
<p>Amazingly, those all worked correctly and I was able to play the game!</p>
<p>However, this game was written a while ago and originally targeted MS-DOS so it has a window size of 320x200 which looks rather ridiculous on my 1920x1080 desktop ;)</p>
<p><a href="{{&quot;/assets/images/2018-08-14-heroes.png&quot; | absolute_url}}"><img alt="Tiny Heroes window screenshot" src="{{&quot;/assets/images/2018-08-14-heroes-small.png&quot; | absolute_url}}" /></a></p>
<p>So I set about trying to set the default screen mode so that the game starts in full screen...</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like this is relatively easy. I just modified a few variables and changed a command line flag from <code>-F | --full-screen</code> to <code>-W | --windowed</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, rather than rely on <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>'s built-in scaling (it looks blurry and weird), I need to enable Heroes' quadruple flag <code>-4</code> by default. In fact, I removed all the scaling options and just left it to default to scaling 4-fold as that leaves the game with a resolution of 1280x800 which seems a reasonable default these days. I'm sure I'll receive bug reports if it's not ;)</p>
<p>The very last thing I've done is to enable the high quality mixer by default and remove the command line option from the game. CPU is a little more abundant now than it was in 2002 ;)</p>
<p><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/heroes-0.21.patch?h=heroes">Here's my final patch file</a>.</p>
<h2>Submitting the AUR package</h2>
<p>Things have changed since I last submitted a package to the AUR so here's a brief writeup - if only to remind myself in future ;)</p>
<p>First step was to update the SSH key in my AUR account as it contained a key from my old machine.</p>
<p>Next up, I added a remote to my repository:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>remote<span class="w"> </span>add<span class="w"> </span>aur<span class="w"> </span>ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/heroes.git
<span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>fetch<span class="w"> </span>aur<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># This step causes AUR to create a record for the package</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The next step is to generate AUR's <code>.SRCINFO</code> file and rebase it into every commit (AUR requires this).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>filter-branch<span class="w"> </span>--tree-filter<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;makepkg --printsrcinfo &gt; .SRCINFO&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then push it to the AUR repository:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>push<span class="w"> </span>-u<span class="w"> </span>aur<span class="w"> </span>master
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Testing it out</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/packer/">packer</a> to make using AUR easier (I'm <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">lazy</a>).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">$ </span>packer<span class="w"> </span>-S<span class="w"> </span>heroes
</code></pre></div>

<p>SUCCESS!</p>
<p>All in all, this wasn't anywhere near as painful as I'd expected. Time to play some Heroes :D</p></article>

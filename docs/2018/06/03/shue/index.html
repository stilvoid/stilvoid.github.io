            <article><p>I finally got around to releasing a tool I wrote a while back (git says I started it in November 2015).</p>
<p>It's called Shue and <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue">you can find it on github</a>.</p>
<p>If you dig back in the <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/commits/master">commit history</a>, you'll see that Shue was originally intended as a tool for converting rgb colour values into their nearest equivalent <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html">bash colour codes</a>.</p>
<p>Shue doesn't do that now as I haven't really needed anything that does it since that one time :) I might bring back that functionality at some point but for now, here's what Shue <em>does</em> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converts colour representations between various rgb formats: 6-digit hex (e.g. <code>#ff9900</code>), 3-digit hex (e.g. <code>#f90</code>), and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp">CSS-style</a> RGB values (e.g. <code>rgb(255, 153, 0)</code>.</li>
<li>Perform a few basic operations on colours before converting to the various representations:<ul>
<li>Invert</li>
<li>Darken</li>
<li>Lighten</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote this at the time because I was fiddling with a few websites and frequently needed the above functionality.</p>
<p>It's written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and there are binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/releases">releases page</a>.</p>

                <p>Because I work on a lot of different projects spread across a lot of accounts at multiple git hosting providers, I try to keep my code folder in some semblance of order by having subfolders for things.</p>
<p>A while ago, I decided to make things even simpler by letting the git repos I was cloning dictate where they should live. I took inspiration from <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#ImportPaths">the way go expects you to organise your code</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I decided to apply <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">the three virtues</a> and wrote some code to handle this for me.</p>
<h2>Introducing git-get</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get">git-get</a> is an opinionated git command that helps you keep your code folder in order.</p>
<p>You use git-get as a replacement for <code>git clone</code> and it will decide where your code should live :)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>git<span class="w"> </span>get<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get
Cloning<span class="w"> </span>into<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;/home/steve/code/github.com/stilvoid/git-get&#39;</span>...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Laziness is the primary virtue.</p>

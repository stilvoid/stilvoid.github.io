            <h1>Back to the Primitive</h1>

            <p>I like text, plain text. Always have. But over the past several years
(and it has been, as the kids say, a hot minute since I <a href="/blog/2019-11-13/">last
blogged</a>) I&#39;ve found more and more bloat creeping
into my daily life. I moved to a Mac Mini as my main machine about 4
years ago as I just gave up in the struggle between the way I think
things ought to be and the &#34;needs&#34; of life working for a large
corporate. In fairness, I have come to more or less enjoy MacOS but
whenever I slip back into my Arch box with my i3 desktop, it feels <em>so
sleek</em>.</p>

<p>Moving to the Mac has necessarily meant changing some of my regular
workflow and tools. I don&#39;t know what it is about the Mac but it seemed
to discourage me from being so heavily terminal-based as I was. I really
can&#39;t put my finger on it. Regardless, I ended up moving from taking
notes in markdown to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for a while and
then eventually <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a>. Still just markdown files
in a folder but the GUI is ever-present. I even found myself starting to
use, and almost enjoy, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>!</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is, through <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-289/">Late Night
Linux</a>, I
discovered <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">Vimwiki</a> and have started to
love the terminal (and Vim) again. In fact, I started writing some code
the other day and just automatically started it in Vim rather than VS
Code. The rot is beginning to recede eh ;)</p>

<p>One of the tasks I decided to bring over to Vimwiki was maintaining my
small and fairly pointless <a href="https://engledow.me">website</a>. In another
show of bloat, I had been through various markdown-to-website tools
(ghost, hugo, jekyll), decided I disliked something about each one, and
ended up rolling my own Python cruft. Inevitably, I came back to the
site to make some changes after a few months and had <em>completely</em>
forgotten how any of it was meant to work :) And that is what led me to
the decision to try Vimwiki for the site as well as my note-taking.</p>

<p>The first challenge is that, while Vimwiki supports markdown syntax, it
doesn&#39;t support it very well and requires more plugins to get it to spit
out html. Over the years, my enthusiasm for markdown has waned
considerably. I like the overall style of the markup but it&#39;s just too
ambiguous and ends up causing more problems than it solves. So... the
tool I want to use has it&#39;s own syntax and I&#39;m not tied to my usual
preference... obviously it&#39;s time to figure out how to convert all my
existing <a href="/blog/">posts</a> ;)</p>

<p>I spent a nice afternoon discovering that <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>
is even more lovely than I had previously realised. Writing a new reader
or writer for it is almost trivial. You write a lua file, create a few
functions to parse/create text in various formats (e.g. emphasised, code
blocks, bullet points), and then point pandoc at your lua file as if it
were any other reader/writer option.</p>

<p>So here we are. This very infrequently updated blog is now written in
vimwiki and I&#39;m back to using the terminal and Vim on a daily basis like
the <a href="/blog/2017-07-10/">last few years</a> never happened.</p>

<p>Now to see what else I can over-enthusiastically convince myself should
be a Wiki...</p>

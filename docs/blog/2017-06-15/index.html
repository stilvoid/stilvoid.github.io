            <h1>The day of linux on the desktop</h1>

            <p>It’s been a while since I last tried out a different desktop environment
on my laptop and I’ve been using <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> for some time
now so it’s only fair to give other things a go ;)</p>

<p>To test these out, I ran another X display - keeping my original one
running so I could switch back and forth to take notes - and started
each environment with <code>DISPLAY=:1 &lt;the command to start the desktop&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I’ll start with just one today and perhaps review some others another
time.</p>

<h2 id="deepin">Deepin</h2>

<p>In summary: bits of Gnome Shell, Chrome OS, and Mac OSX but not quite as
polished as any of them.</p>

<p>The Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE - from <a href="https://www.deepin.org/en/?language=en">the Deepin
distribution</a>) installed easily
enough under Arch with a quick <code>pacman -S deepin deepin-extra</code>. It also
started up easily with an unambiguous <code>startdde</code>.</p>

<p>Immediately on startup, DDE plays a slightly annoying chime presumably
just to remind you of how far we’ve come since Windows 95. The initial
view of the desktop looks similar to OSX or Chrome OS with file icons on
the desktop and a launcher bar centred across the bottom of the screen.</p>

view"/></p>

<p>The first thing I tried was clicking on a button labelled Quoted only to
be presented with a prompt telling me Quoted and an OK button. So far,
so enigmatic. So then I tried a trusty right-click on the desktop which
brought up the expected context menu. In the menu was a Quoted option so
I plumped for that, thinking that perhaps that was where I could enable
the mystic Quoted. Clicking the Quoted button opened a dark-themed panel
from the right-hand side, similar to the information panel you get in
OSX. I searched through that panel for a good couple of minutes but
could find no allusion to any Quoted.</p>

panel"/></p>

<p>Unperturbed, I decided to press on and see what other features Deepin
had to offer…</p>

<p>Moving the mouse around the desktop a bit, I discovered that Deepin has
borrowed some ideas from Gnome shell as well as OSX and Chrome OS.
Moving the mouse pointer into the top-left corner of the screen brings
up an application list similar to Gnome’s launcher. The bottom-right
corner reveals the settings panel. The top-right does nothing and the
bottom-left, wonder of wonders, brings up my old favourite, the Quoted.</p>

<p>I poked around in the settings a bit more but didn’t really see anything
of interest so I fired up what looks to be the last part of Deepin left
for me to explore: the file manager. It does the job and it’s not very
interesting although I did discover that Deepin also has it’s own
terminal emulator (unsurprisingly called <code>deepin-terminal</code>) which has a
snazzy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">Matrix</a> theme to it
but is otherwise uninteresting.</p>

<p>That’s it, I’m bored. Next!</p>

<p>I tried Budgie and LXQT for a few minutes each at this point but they
weren’t immediately interesting enough to make me want to write about
them just now :)</p>

            <h1>TBC</h1>

            <p>In tidying up my corner of the interwebs, I put together a list of
projects that I&#39;ve worked on over the years. One
of those is <a href="https://engledow.me/games/#falsoyd">Falsoyd</a>. I commented &#34;I don&#39;t
know if it even compiles on modern systems&#34;. Of course, that stuck in my
head and inevitably I had to try...</p>

<p>Hoooo boy.</p>

<p>It has been a <em>long time</em> since I wrote anything in my <a href="https://engledow.me/blog/2014-01-31/">once-favourite language, C</a> (or C++). <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Astilvoid+AND+%28language%3AC+OR+language%3AC%2B%2B%29&amp;type=code">A GitHub
search</a>
suggests it&#39;s been around 10 years. Fortunately, I had no intentions of
really fixing any coding problems - just getting Falsoyd to run by brute
force :D</p>

<h2 id="it-starts">It starts</h2>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:stilvoid/falysoyd
cd falsoyd
make
...
sdl-config: command not found
fatal error: &#39;SDL_mixer.h&#39; file not found
</code></pre>

<p>Oh yeah, this was all SDL. Oh well, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s still around!</p>

<pre><code>brew install sdl
Warning: Formula sdl was renamed to sdl12-compat.
</code></pre>

<p>Ok well, it turns out SDL1.2 is looong deprecated but some kind person
has written a compatibility library for SDL2 so that should all work
quite nicely...</p>

<pre><code>make
fatal error: &#39;SDL_mixer.h&#39; file not found
brew install sdl_mixer
Error: sdl_mixer has been disabled because it is deprecated upstream! It was disabled on 2024-02-07.
</code></pre>

<p>If only I had tried this 6 months ago ;) After a quick look, SDL2_mixer
seems to have the same API as in SDL1.2 so I&#39;ll nab the header file from
there, include it in my CFLAGS, and link to SDL2_mixer in addition to
the SDL1.2 (compat) library. What could possibly go wrong?!</p>

<pre><code>make
...
src/map.h:35:6: error: cast from pointer to smaller type &#39;int&#39; loses information
        p.x=(int)x;
            ^~~~~~
src/map.h:36:6: error: cast from pointer to smaller type &#39;int&#39; loses information
        p.y=(int)y;
</code></pre>

<p>Ooh, an actual bug. Forgot to dereference some pointers. I wonder how
that ever worked before. Well, it&#39;s an easy fix!</p>

<pre><code>make
...
g++  src/world.o src/audio.o src/score.o src/bonus.o src/shot.o src/sprite.o src/ship.o src/alien.o src/main.o -o src/falsoyd `sdl-config --libs` -lSDL2_mixer
</code></pre>

<p>It compiled! That was unexpectedly easy. I was anticipating some
nastiness with mixing SDL1.2 and SDL2_mixer.</p>

<p>(I glossed over <em>a lot</em> of compiler warnings in that &#34;...&#34; btw. Don&#39;t
ignore your compiler warnings, folks!)</p>

<p>My fingers began to tremble (they didn&#39;t) as I nervously (I wasn&#39;t)
typed <code>./src/falsoyd</code>...</p>

<p><img src="https://static.offend.me.uk/media/images/2024-08-28-falsoyd.png" alt="A screenshot of
Falsoyd"/></p>

<p>It runs! I played it for a little while. Remembered how terrible it was
and committed <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/falsoyd/tree/2024">a branch</a>
with my changes. That&#39;ll do for now. Itch scratched.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m clearly going to have to make Falsoyd 2 in LÃ¶ve, Pico-8, or
Picotron ;)</p>

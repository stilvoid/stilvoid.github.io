<p>
I have a lot of half-finished crap on <a href="https://github.com/stilvoid">GitHub</a>.
This is a curated selection of the more finished, actually useful stuff.
</p>

<p>
Most of it is quite old at this point but still relevant.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/please">please</a> is a command line utility that makes it easy to integrate web APIs into your shell scripts.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/maur">maur</a> is a minimal tool for searching and installing packages from the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/ps1">PS1</a> is my custom <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bash/Prompt_customization">bash prompt</a> with some nice features.  I've been using this daily every since I wrote it.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/logoids">Logoids</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> clone where you provide the Asteroid images.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/falsoyd">Falsoyd</a> is a terrible game I wrote around 2000CE. tbh I don't know if it even compiles on modern systems.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get">git-get</a> is another tool I still use every day.  Replaces <code>git clone</code> but organises repositories by their origin under <code>~/code</code>.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/git-cube">git-cube</a> reminds you to commit before you exit a shell session.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/shue">shue</a> is a command line tool for modifying and converting colour values for use with CSS etc.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/git-aux">git-aux</a> allows you to use git to manage replicating your dotfiles between machines and that sort of things.

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/stilvoid/babel">Babel</a> is an easy-to-parse and easy-to-produce data exchange format for easing communication between processes written in different programming languages. There are definitely beter choices for this now but I do have some ideas for a future iteration of this.

</ul>

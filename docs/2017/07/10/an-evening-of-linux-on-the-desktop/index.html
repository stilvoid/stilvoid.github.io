Well, as with desktop environments, so with text editors. I decided briefly that I would try a few of the more recent code editors that are around these days.

As for the integrated environment, when you have tmux running by default, everything’s integrated anyway." />

    <p><a href="https://engledow.me/blog/88/">Last time</a>, I wrote about trying a few desktop environments to see what’s out there, keep things fresh, and keep me from complacency. Well, as with desktop environments, so with text editors. I decided briefly that I would try <a href="https://atom.io/">a few of</a> <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">the more recent</a> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">code editors</a> that are around these days. Lured in by their pleasing, modern visuals and their promises of a smooth, integrated experience, I’ve been meaning to give these a go for a while. Needless to say, as a long-time <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> user, I just found myself frustrated that I wasn’t able to get things done as efficiently in any of those editors as I could in vim ;) I tried installing vim keybindings in Atom but it just wasn’t the same as a very limited set of functionality was there. As for the integrated environment, when you have <a href="https://engledow.me/blog/46">tmux running by default</a>, everything’s integrated anyway.</p>

<p>And, as with editors, so once again with desktop environments. I’ve decided to retract my previous hasty promise and no longer to bother with trying any other environments; <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> is more than fine :)</p>

<p>However, I did spend some time this evening making things a bit prettier so here are some delicious configs for posterity:</p>

<h2 id="configs">Configs</h2>

<h3 id="xresources">Xresources</h3>

<p>I’ve switched back to xterm from urxvt because, er… dunno.</p>

<p>Anyway, I set some nice colours for terminals and some magic stuff that makes man pages all colourful :)</p>

<h3 id="vimrc">Vimrc</h3>

<p>Nothing exciting here except for discovering a few options I hadn’t previous known about:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span class="c">" Show a marker at the 80th column to encourage nice code</span>
<span class="k">set</span> colorcolumn<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">80</span>
highlight ColorColumn ctermbg<span class="p">=</span>darkblue

<span class="c">" Scroll the text when we're 3 lines from the top or bottom</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="k">so</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">3</span>

<span class="c">" Use browser-style incremental search</span>
<span class="k">set</span> incsearch

<span class="c">" Override the default background colour in xoria256 to match the terminal background</span>
highlight Normal ctermbg<span class="p">=</span>black

<span class="c">" I like this theme</span>
<span class="k">colorscheme</span> xoria256</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="i3">i3</h3>

<p>I made a few colour tweaks to my i3 config so I get colours that match my new Xresources. One day, I might see if it’s easy enough to have them both read colour definitions from the same place so I don’t have to define things twice.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>

<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>

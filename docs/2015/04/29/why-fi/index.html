                <p>I'm an <a href="http://archlinux.org">arch linux</a> user and I love it; there's no other distro for me. The things that arch gets criticism for are the exact same reasons I love it and they all more or less boil down to one thing: arch does not hold your hand.</p>
<p>It's been a while since an update in arch caused me any problems but it did today.</p>
<p><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196584">It seems there's an issue</a> with the latest version of <code>wpa_supplicant</code> which renders it incompatible with the way wifi is setup at boot time. The problem was caught and resolved very quickly by package maintainers who simply rolled the <code>wpa_supplicant</code> package back. However, I was unlucky enough to have caught the intervening upgrade shortly before turning my laptop off. I came home this evening to find I had no wifi!</p>
<p>This wasn't a huge challenge but I haven't written a blog post for a while and someone might find this useful:</p>
<hr />
<p>If your wifi doesn't start at boot...</p>
<p>And you're using <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/xps-13-9333/spd/xps-13-9333">a laptop with no ethernet port</a>...</p>
<p>And you know an upgrade will solve your problem...</p>
<p>How do you get internet so you can upgrade?</p>
<p>Simples :)</p>
<h2>The steps</h2>
<p>First, find the name of your wireless interface:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>iw<span class="w"> </span>dev
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which will output something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="go">phy#0</span>
<span class="go">    Interface wlp2s0</span>
<span class="go">        ifindex 2</span>
<span class="go">        wdev 0x1</span>
<span class="go">        addr e8:b1:fc:6c:bf:b5</span>
<span class="go">        type managed</span>
<span class="go">        channel 11 (2462 MHz), width: 20 MHz, center1: 2462 MHz</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Where <code>wlp2s0</code> is the bit we're interested in.</p>
<p>Now bring the interface up:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ip<span class="w"> </span>link<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">set</span><span class="w"> </span>wlp2s0<span class="w"> </span>up
</code></pre></div>

<p>Connect to the access point:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>iw<span class="w"> </span>dev<span class="w"> </span>wlp2s0<span class="w"> </span>connect<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;AP name&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Create a temporary configuration file for <code>wpa_supplicant</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>wpa_passphrase<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;AP name&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>/tmp/wpa.config
</code></pre></div>

<p>Run <code>wpa_supplicant</code> to authenticate with the access point:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>wpa_supplication<span class="w"> </span>-iwlp2s0<span class="w"> </span>-c/tmp/wpa.config
</code></pre></div>

<p>In another terminal (or you could have backgrounded the above), run <code>dhcpcd</code> to get an IP address from your router:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>dhcpcd<span class="w"> </span>wlp2s0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Update and reboot or whatever :)</p>

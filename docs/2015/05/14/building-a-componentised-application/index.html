        </header>

        <main>
            <article><p>Most of what's here is hardly new ground but I felt it worth noting down the current strategy we're using to develop and build what we're working on at <a href="http://www.locationsciences.ai/">Proxama</a>.</p>
<p>Without going into any of the details, it's a web application with a front end written using <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> and various services that it calls out to, written using whatever seems appropriate per service.</p>
<p>At the outset of the project, we decided we would bite the bullet and build for <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> from the outset. This meant we would get to avoid the usual dependency and developer environment setup nightmares.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>What we quickly realised as we started to put the bare bones of a few of the services in place, was that we had three seemingly conflicting goals for each component and for the application as a whole.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build images that can be deployed in production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow developers to run services locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a means for running unit tests (both by developers and our CI server).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So here's what we've ended up with:</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p><em>Or: <a href="http://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> to the rescue</em></p>
<h3>Folder structure</h3>
<p>Here's what the project layout looks like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="go">Project</span>
<span class="go">|</span>
<span class="go">+-docker-compose.yml</span>
<span class="go">|</span>
<span class="go">+-Service 1</span>
<span class="go">| |</span>
<span class="go">| +-Dockerfile</span>
<span class="go">| |</span>
<span class="go">| +-docker.compose.yml</span>
<span class="go">| |</span>
<span class="go">| +-&lt;other files&gt;</span>
<span class="go">|</span>
<span class="go">+-Service 2</span>
<span class="go">  |</span>
<span class="go">  |</span>
<span class="go">  +-Dockerfile</span>
<span class="go">  |</span>
<span class="go">  +-docker.compose.yml</span>
<span class="go">  |</span>
<span class="go">  +-&lt;other files&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Building for production</h3>
<p>This is the easy bit and is where we started first. The <code>Dockerfile</code> for each service was designed to run everything with the defaults. Usually, this is something simple like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">python:3-onbuild</span>
<span class="k">CMD</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;python&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;main.py&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Our CI server can easily take these, produce images, and push them to the registry.</p>
<h3>Allowing developers to run services locally</h3>
<p>This is slightly harder. In general, each service wants to do something slightly different when being run for development; e.g. automatically restarting when code changes. Additionally, we don't want to have to rebuild an image every time we make a code change. This is where <code>docker-compose</code> comes in handy.</p>
<p>The <code>docker-compose.yml</code> at the root of the project folder looks like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">service1</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">build</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Service 1</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">environment</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nt">ENV</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">dev</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">volumes</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Service 1:/usr/src/app</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">links</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">service2</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">ports</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">8001:8000</span>

<span class="nt">service2</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">build</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Service2</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">environment</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nt">ENV</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">dev</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">volumes</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Service 2:/usr/src/app</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">links</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">service1</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">ports</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">8002:8000</span>

<span class="nt">db</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">image</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">mongo</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gives us several features right away:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can locally run all of the services together with <code>docker-compose up</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ENV</code> environment variable is set to <code>dev</code> in each service so that the service can configure itself when it starts to run things in "dev" mode where needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source folder for each service is mounted inside the container. This means you don't need to rebuild the image to try out new code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each service is bound to a different port so you can connect to each part directly where needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each service defines links to the other services it needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running the tests</h3>
<p>This was the trickiest part to get right. Some services have dependencies on other things even just to get unit tests running. For example, <a href="http://python-eve.org/">Eve</a> is a huge pain to get running with a fake database so it's much easier to just link it to a temporary "real" database.</p>
<p>Additionally, we didn't want to mess with the idea that the images should run production services by default but also didn't want to require folks to need to churn out complicated <code>docker</code> invocations like <code>docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app --link db:db service1 python -m unittest</code> just to run the test suite after coding up some new features.</p>
<p>So, it was docker-compose to the rescue again :)</p>
<p>Each service has a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that looks something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">tests</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">build</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">.</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">command</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">python -m unittest</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">volumes</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">.:/usr/src/app</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">links</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>

<span class="nt">db</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">image</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">mongo</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which sets up any dependencies needed just for the tests, mounts the local source in the container, and runs the desired command for running the tests.</p>
<p>So, a developer (or the CI box) can run the unit tests with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>docker-compose<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="w"> </span>tests
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each <code>Dockerfile</code> builds an image that can go straight into production without further configuration required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each image runs in "developer mode" if the <code>ENV</code> environment variable is set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running <code>docker-compose up</code> from the root of the project gets you a full stack running locally in developer mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running <code>docker-compose run tests</code> in each service's own folder will run the unit tests for that service - starting any dependencies as needed.</p>
</li>

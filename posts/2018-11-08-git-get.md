Because I work on a lot of different projects spread across a lot of accounts at multiple git hosting providers, I try to keep my code folder in some semblance of order by having subfolders for things.

A while ago, I decided to make things even simpler by letting the git repos I was cloning dictate where they should live. I took inspiration from [the way go expects you to organise your code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#ImportPaths).

Today, I decided to apply [the three virtues](http://threevirtues.com/) and wrote some code to handle this for me.

## Introducing git-get

[git-get](https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get) is an opinionated git command that helps you keep your code folder in order.

You use git-get as a replacement for `git clone` and it will decide where your code should live :)

```shell
git get https://github.com/stilvoid/git-get
Cloning into '/home/steve/code/github.com/stilvoid/git-get'...
```

Laziness is the primary virtue.

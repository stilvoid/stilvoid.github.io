I finally got around to releasing a tool I wrote a while back (git says I started it in November 2015).

It's called Shue and [you can find it on github](https://github.com/stilvoid/shue).

If you dig back in the [commit history](https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/commits/master), you'll see that Shue was originally intended as a tool for converting rgb colour values into their nearest equivalent [bash colour codes](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html).

Shue doesn't do that now as I haven't really needed anything that does it since that one time :) I might bring back that functionality at some point but for now, here's what Shue *does* do:

* Converts colour representations between various rgb formats: 6-digit hex (e.g. `#ff9900`), 3-digit hex (e.g. `#f90`), and [CSS-style](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) RGB values (e.g. `rgb(255, 153, 0)`.
* Perform a few basic operations on colours before converting to the various representations:
    * Invert
    * Darken
    * Lighten

I wrote this at the time because I was fiddling with a few websites and frequently needed the above functionality.

It's written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and there are binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the [releases page](https://github.com/stilvoid/shue/releases).
